Problem 8b
This application is about the parts supplied by suppliers to projects.
This defines an N-ary relationship between parts, suppliers, and projects.

This N-ary relationship is shown in Design A. Suppliers can supply Parts 
with a specific qty and price to Projects.

However, Design B incorporates only binary relationships between Suppliers
and Parts, Projects and Parts, and Suppliers and Projects. There is no way
to determine the amount of parts supplied by a supplier to a specific 
project.
